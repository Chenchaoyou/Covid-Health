Among US states and counties, disease prevention performance are drastically different in terms of positive cases and mortality during the crisis. In hindsight, we would like to ask ourselves why some regions were being hit worse than others. Do factors such as racial, political, or economical differences contribute to the contrasting regional impact of Covid-19? Any insights we gained through investigating this issue can potentially save lives in future great pandemics. In this project, we will take a closer look at geographic/economic/demographic/political differences between different counties within New York State, in hopes to shed more light on the factors that may or may not have a correlation with Covid situation in each county. We will provide early exploratory data analysis at this stage of the project. Causation will not be implied by correlation at early exploratory analysis but will offer directions in which we can further investigate. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Six different datasets corresponding to five factor variables plus one dependent variable are gathered for this project. They are: *Health Data (./dataset/Covid, gathered by Chenchao) *Political Data (./dataset/Election, gathered by Natasha) *Economic Data (./dataset/Income, gathered by Chenchao) *Geographic Data (./dataset/Map, gathered by Chenchao) *Demographic Data (./dataset/Race, gathered by Chenchao) *Labor Mobility Data (./dataset/Work_Residence, gathered by Chenchao) Health Data is collected through State of New York Open Data (https://data.ny.gov/) under the Covid-19 Tag. The dataset consists of new/cumulative positive cases of Covid and new/cumulative test numbers gathered by date and by counties. A total of 16926 rows are reported. Political Data, namely the 2020 and 2016 presidential election results data, are gathered through NYS Board of Elections (https://www.elections.ny.gov). The data records number of voters who voted for different presidential candidate by each county. A total of 64 rows of data are reported (62 counties + total vote by candidate + total vote by party). Geographic Data is the NYS map in the form of shapefile, which is ready to be used in mapping variables to counties. Economic Data are collected from US Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) under the keyword INCOME/POVERTY. The data shows total number of population and population determined to be under poverty by county reports. Demographic Data are gathered from US Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) under the keyword race. We chose the more general race data over the specific detailed race subgroup count, because we believe that race subgroups are too detailed for observing patterns in the exploratory data analysis. The dataset consists of race counts by counties. There are 62 rows of data each corresponding to a county. Labor Mobility Data are also from US Census Bureau (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) under the keyword PLACE OF WORK. It consists of number of workers working inside/outside place of residence and the number of population without residence, reported by each county. The data has 62 rows corresponding to 62 county reports. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The datasets are all under the dataset folder (./dataset), and we will discuss the data cleaning/transformation of each dataset in details below: *Health Data (./dataset/Covid): the data is in good shape as it is. We only changed the column names, replacing blank spaces with underscores for better R compatibility. *Political Data (./dataset/Election): the data is also clean and we only changed the column names, replacing blank spaces and abbreviated election candidate names. The political data contains a few missing values and we will explain how to deal with those in chapter 4. We will omit the total count rows, which leaves us 62 rows corresponding to 62 county observations. *Economic Data (./dataset/Income): the economic data is gathered from US census bureau, thus the margin of error is provided for each column. After careful observation, we decided that the margin of error is trivial comparing to the reported numbers and thus we can omit the margin errors in our exploratory data analysis. The dataset is transposed to have counties in rows and variables in columns. Same column name replacement is performed to have better compatibility with R. We also deleted sub-columns corresponding to economic data of demographic subgroups. We believe that if the bin size is too small, the patterns will be less obvious in the exploratory visualization. The data has lots of missing values and we will explain how to deal with it in chapter 4 missing values. *Geographic Data (./dataset/Map): this is a shapefile that can be imported with rgdal package in R. *Demographic Data (./dataset/Race): the demographic data is collected from US census bureau. The same margin of error omittance, column name replacement, and table transposition are performed. *Labor Mobility Data (./dataset/Work_Residence): the labor data is collected from US census bureau. The same margin of error omittance, column name replacement, and table transposition are performed. We also deleted sub-columns that corresponds to categories that are too subdivided. *X_Variable Data (./dataset/X): After cleaning the datasets listed above, we have obtained five different datasets (Health, Political, Economic, Geographic, and Demographic) that share same 62 indexes corresponding to 62 index county. We merge all five datasets by county index into one big X_Variable dataset which is more user-friendly. The suffix of county index names are removed so that index names are compatible with the geo-information inside NYS shapefile. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Political Data Missing Values 4.2 Income Data Missing Values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We observed missing values in the Political Data and Income Data, which is visualized below via extracat::visna approach. The missing value distribution will be visualized and method to replace NA values will be proposed. 4.1 Political Data Missing Values After taking a closer look at the dataset, we find that the only missing values in the election result dataset are a row missing number of void votes and blank votes. ## # A tibble: 1 x 5 ## County `Biden(DEM)` `Trump(REP)` Void Blank ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Westchester 296129 133397 NA NA We replaced those missing values with the median of the corresponding columns. We choose median over mean because the variance of Void and Blank votes are high and median is more robust when extreme outliers are present. We replace the missing value of Void votes with median value of 202 and Blank votes with median value of 102. 4.2 Income Data Missing Values From the missing pattern visualization we observe that roughly 1/3 of the counties are not reporting any data. We found out that the 2019 estimate from US Census Bureau is not complete and thus data from over 20 counties are not available. To fill the missing values, we decided to estimate the data of the missing counties using the 5-year average from 2014-2018. The resulting filled data is stored under ./dataset/Income/Income.xlsx "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Work-Residence Data and Covid Case Growth 5.2 Income Data and Covid Case Growth 5.3 Race Data and Covid Case Growth 5.4 Political Data and Covid Case Growth", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Work-Residence Data and Covid Case Growth 5.1.1 Choropleth Map showing Commuter-packed Counties and Covid Cases. In our exploratory analysis, we discovered that commuters have a positive correlation with the Covid case grow. The following choropleth map shows some interesting patterns: The heatmap shows the percentage of labor working outside county of residence. Deeper the color of the county is, the more ratio of workforce commutes outside the county. The teal colored circles represent the number of cumulative cases within each month of 2020. We observe the following general pattern for suburban counties: Deeper the color is (More commuters), the more likely that corresponding county experiences an early stage sharp growth in covid numbers. Our hypothesis is that for a suburban county, the more people working outside county of residence, the more likely Covid transmitted early to that county, which resulted in an early rapid growth in case numbers. 5.1.2 Time Series Comparison between Two Counties Covid Growth Comparing the areas of the circles is not an intuitive way to understand the pattern difference. To better understand the difference, we compare two counties suburb counties marked on the map above (Herkimer ~ 50% and Jefferson ~ 4%) that have very different commuter percentages and show their case growth below: In this graph, the green plot and the teal plot represents the cumulative postives in Herkimer and Jefferson county respectively. As we observe in the graph, Herkimer shows a more rapid early growth in covid numbers than Jefferson does. 5.2 Income Data and Covid Case Growth In our exploratory visualization, we attempt to uncover any pattern that links the poverty rate to Covid impact. 5.2.1 Scatterplot showing Covid Positive Rate and Poverty Rate The graph below shows the Covid Positive Rate plotted against Poverty Rate of each county. The positive rate is derived from dividing the Nov 28th cumulative positives by total census population. Surprisingly, the general correlation is rather low (-0.03). However, certain outliers reveal some interesting information. The outliers that are labeled on the scatter plot are mostly counties in or near New York metropolitan area, which are hit hardest due to the high population density within the area. If we only look at the counties within the New York metropolitan area or only the counties outside New York metropolitan area, we could observe a positive correlation between Poverty Rate and Cumulative Case counts. 5.3 Race Data and Covid Case Growth In our investigation, we attempt to discover any correlation between race data and Covid impact in each county. 5.3.1 Biased Racial Data The racial data with respect to each county is drastically different depending on whether the counties are in New York Metropolitan or not. The graph below indicates that if we include all the counties in our exploratory analysis, we probabily wont find any meaningful results due to those outliers. In that sense, we will separate all the metropolitan area counties and surrounding counties from the rest of the counties before attempting to find any correlation. 5.3.2 Scatterplots Showing Correlation Between Race and Covid Case Growth in/outside Metropolitan Areas The graph in display shows the scatterplots of Covid case percentage against race distributions in Metropolitan Areas. The graph in display shows the scatterplots of Covid case percentage against race distributions outside Metropolitan Areas. Overall, we observe some patterns indicating that higher percentage of people of color, higher the covid impact seems to be. However, we immediately noticed that the correlation comes from Third-cause fallacy. The high population density can cause both high number of Covid percentage and high percentage of people of color at the same time. That said, there are some information we can obtain from the scatterplots. It is easy to observe that if we remove outliers which represents densely populated counties from the plot, correlation is rather weak. It suggests that all counties in New York are affected by Covid situation regardless the race distribution. 5.4 Political Data and Covid Case Growth In this part of our data visualization analysis, we want to investigate whether the Covid situation affected the election results of 2020. To be more specific, we want to ask the question whether the covid situation caused counties to flip from red to blue. 5.4.1 Covid Situation in Flipped Counties To visualize our findings, we compare the Covid Positive Rate of four flipped counties (from red to blue) with the average of that from red-shifted counties in 2020. The graph below presents the time series data that shows cumulative positive rates. In general, the flipped counties experience a more rapid covid positive rate growth than the counties that shifted red in 2020. Broome county stands out in terms of covid growth, especially during the period from Oct 2020 to Nov 2020. This may explain the voter turnout in the county. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Click here to watch instruction on Covid-19 "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion We have conduct exploratory analysis that investigated some social and economic data and their possible correlation with covid case growth. Since the analysis is early and exploratory, there are still more to research if we want to imply a causation or to offer policy-making suggestions. For example, we want to design a comparison to control variates if we want to imply a causation between a certain variable and covid case growth. An A/B test or other hypothesis testing are needed to establish solid results. More over, due to the limited amount of time we have on this project, we did not split the data into groups of county inside/near or outside New York metropolitan area. In our study we have discovered that those two groups of county have distinct patterns within each group. For example, in our scatterplot showing covid-poverty correaltions, the correlation is not strong in general but a correlation exists if we look at each group of counties individually. A direction to investigate in the future is to split the dataset into the two groups said and visualize any patterns we can find for each group. "]]
