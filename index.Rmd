# Introduction

The Covid-19 Pandemic of 2020 has irreversibly reshaped the world. Among US states and counties, disease prevention performance are drastically different in terms of positive cases and mortality during the crisis. In hindsight, we would like to ask ourselves why some regions were being hit worse than others. Do factors such as racial, political, or economical differences contribute to the contrasting regional impact of Covid-19? Any insights we gained through investigating this issue can potentially save lives in future great pandemics.

In this project, we will take a closer look at geographic/economic/demographic/political differences between different counties within New York State, in hopes to shed more light on the factors that may or may not have a correlation with Covid situation in each county. We will provide early exploratory data analysis at this stage of the project. Causation will not be implied by correlation at early exploratory analysis but will offer directions in which we can further investigate.
